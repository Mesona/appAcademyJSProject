# Creature Battle

## Background and Overview
* This game allows you to equip a creature with various equipment, augmenting its abilities, before it fights another creature.  The battles are automated, and the creatures act based on equipment and personality.

* This game was inspired by the old PS1 era Monster Rancher series, which had many unique systems I have not seen replicated since.
